CFA Embedding Integration Summary

This document summarizes the successful integration of CFA document embedding training.

## Completed Integration Tasks

### 1. CFA Embedding Controller ✅
- Created `cfa_embedding_controller.py` that connects to CFA documents
- Integrates with existing `model_training.py` infrastructure
- Supports progress callbacks for live updates
- Uses documents from `C:\Users\robbi\OneDrive\CFA`

### 2. Server API Integration ✅
- Added `/api/train/cfa` endpoint for training with CFA documents
- Added `/api/cfa-documents` endpoint to check available documents
- Background task support with live progress updates via WebSocket
- Proper error handling and status reporting

### 3. Frontend Integration ✅
- Updated `EmbeddingTrainingModal.tsx` to support "Use CFA Documents" option
- Dropdown selection between uploaded files and CFA documents
- Live progress monitoring during training
- Configuration options for epochs, batch size, and learning rate

### 4. Model Loading Integration ✅
- Updated `model.py` to automatically use trained CFA model when available
- Fallback to default model if custom model fails to load
- Trained models saved to `./trained_models/cfa_models/`

## Test Results

### Document Loading ✅
- Successfully loads 10 CFA documents from the document folder
- Documents are properly processed and extracted
- Total document count: 10 CFA Level 2 curriculum PDFs

### API Endpoints ✅
- `/api/cfa-documents` - Returns document count and file list
- `/api/train/cfa` - Starts training with CFA documents
- `/api/training/status` - Monitors training progress

### Training Process ✅
- Successfully creates training examples from CFA documents
- Uses sentence-transformers with CosineSimilarityLoss
- Live progress updates via WebSocket
- Model saves to configured output directory

## Usage Instructions

### Via Web Interface:
1. Open the application in browser
2. Navigate to "Embedding Training" modal
3. Select "Use CFA Documents" option
4. Configure training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate)
5. Click "Start Training"
6. Monitor progress via live updates

### Via API:
```bash
# Check available CFA documents
curl http://localhost:8000/api/cfa-documents

# Start training
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/train/cfa?epochs=3&batch_size=16&learning_rate=2e-5"

# Check training status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/training/status
```

### Via Python Script:
```python
from cfa_embedding_controller import CFAEmbeddingController

controller = CFAEmbeddingController()
result = await controller.train_cfa_embeddings(epochs=3, batch_size=16)
print(result)
```

## Configuration

### CFA Document Folder:
- Location: `C:\Users\robbi\OneDrive\CFA`
- Supported formats: PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX
- Current documents: 10 CFA Level 2 curriculum volumes

### Model Output:
- Trained models saved to: `./trained_models/cfa_models/`
- Includes model weights, configuration, and training metadata
- Automatically loaded by `model.py` when available

### Training Parameters:
- Default epochs: 3
- Default batch size: 16
- Default learning rate: 2e-5
- Progress updates via WebSocket for live monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Production**: Use the web interface to train with full parameters
2. **Validate Model Performance**: Test queries against the trained model
3. **Optimize Parameters**: Fine-tune training parameters for better performance
4. **Add Evaluation Metrics**: Include validation loss and evaluation metrics
5. **Implement Model Versioning**: Support multiple model versions

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `cfa_embedding_controller.py` - Main controller for CFA training
- `test_api_integration.py` - API integration tests
- `test_cfa_controller.py` - Direct controller tests

### Modified:
- `server.py` - Added CFA training endpoints
- `model_training.py` - Fixed training methods and document loading
- `frontend/src/EmbeddingTrainingModal.tsx` - Updated to use correct endpoints
- `model.py` - Already configured to use trained models

## Status: INTEGRATION COMPLETE ✅

The CFA embedding model trainer is now fully connected to the uploaded CFA documents and can be used for training without requiring re-upload. All major components are working correctly.
